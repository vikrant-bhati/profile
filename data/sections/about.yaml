# a summary about you
summary: "I am a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech (graduating May 2026), with nearly seven years of experience across software development and machine learning. My background covers backend systems, scalable cloud platforms, AI-driven applications, and FPGA-based embedded systems. \n

During my graduate studies, I have worked on a range of projects that connect my software engineering experience with advanced machine learning techniques, including:

- Evaluating CNN architectures (ResNet18 variants with attention and ODConv) on ImageNet and Pascal VOC datasets.

- Optimizing large language models (Qwen 2.5B) using GRPO with Chain-of-Thought reasoning for medical data. 

- Developing generative AI solutions, such as anime image generation with GANs.

- Creating a gesture-controlled version of Asphalt 8, using MediaPipe and OpenCV for finger-based controls.

- Building a recommendation model for Instacart, leveraging EDA and machine learning (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to analyze purchasing patterns and improve user experience.


I am currently a Co-op Software Developer at Viavi Solutions (JDSU), where I develop high-performance software for FPGA-based embedded systems, enabling real-time data acquisition and processing for advanced network testing. Prior to my master’s, I spent six years at Fiserv, where I designed and built large-scale distributed systems supporting fintech and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs). My key contributions include developing compliance and inventory management microservices, and delivering full-stack financial solutions such as Card Free Cash and GDPR-compliant Contact Services. \n

Beyond my professional roles, I have trained and mentored engineers, led high-impact technical projects, and won multiple global hackathons. My goal is to leverage my combined expertise in system-level engineering and AI to deliver innovative, scalable, and impactful solutions."
