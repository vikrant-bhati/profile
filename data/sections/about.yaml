# a summary about you
summary: "I am a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech (graduating May 2026), bringing almost seven years of experience to every project. My background spans backend systems, scalable cloud solutions, AI-driven applications, and working with FPGA-based embedded systems. \n

During my graduate studies, I have worked on a range of projects that combine my software engineering experience with advanced machine learning techniques. Projects include evaluating CNN architectures (ResNet18 variants with attention and ODConv) on ImageNet and Pascal VOC datasets, optimizing large language models using GRPO with Chain-of-Thought reasoning for medical data, and developing generative AI solutions like anime image generation with GANs, all resulting in measurable improvements. I have also developed computer vision applications, such as a gesture-controlled game using MediaPipe and OpenCV.

I am currently a Co-op Software Developer at Viavi Solutions (JDSU), where I develop high-performance C++ software for FPGA-based embedded systems that enable real-time data acquisition and processing for advanced network testing. Before starting my master’s, I spent six years at Fiserv, where I worked on designing and building large-scale distributed systems, developing compliance and inventory management microservices, delivering full-stack financial solutions like Card Free Cash, Inventory Management systems, GDPR Guidelines based Contact Service and leading engineering teams. \n

I work with Python, Java, C++, and SQL, and have hands-on experience with cloud platforms including GCP, AWS, and Azure, as well as frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Spring Boot. I have trained and mentored engineers, initiated high-impact technical projects, and won multiple global hackathons. My goal is to leverage my combined expertise in system-level engineering and AI to deliver innovative, scalable, and impactful solutions."
